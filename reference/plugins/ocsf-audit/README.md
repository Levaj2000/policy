# cpex-plugin-ocsf-audit

A CPEX CMF plugin that emits each dispatched request as an **OCSF AI Operation event**, off
the `run(audit-log)` seam — optionally wrapped in a tamper-evident **attestation chain** and
DSSE-signed.

It is a near-twin of the upstream [`audit-logger`](https://github.com/contextforge-org/cpex/tree/dev/builtins/plugins/audit-logger)
builtin (same observation-only, always-allow contract; same factory + hook wiring). The only
difference is the record shape:

| | `audit-logger` (upstream) | `ocsf-audit` (this crate) |
|---|---|---|
| Output | free-form JSON line | OCSF AI Operation event |
| Verifiability | none | hash chain (`fingerprint`→`prev_event`), DSSE-signed (ECDSA P-256) |
| Schema | ad hoc | OCSF — interoperable across tools |

**Why:** it makes CPEX's enforcement record *interoperable* (OCSF) and *independently
verifiable* (signed attestation chain) **without CPEX having to own a schema**. CPEX produces
the event; this plugin makes it portable and verifiable offline. That is the AI Identity lane
in the interop map: the record/evidence layer.

## The mapping

The executable CMF `Message` + `Extensions` → OCSF field mapping is [`src/ocsf.rs`](src/ocsf.rs).
(The prose field-map table is maintained privately — it quotes unreleased CPEX branch internals —
so the source is the public reference.)
Five fields have no native OCSF home yet (`completion.stop_reason`, `mcp.*`, `framework.*`,
monotonic security labels, full workload attestation); the plugin emits them under OCSF
`unmapped` (config `include_gap_fields`, default on). That preserves evidence **and** makes the
open OCSF/WS4 gaps self-documenting in the wire output.

## Wiring (APL)

**Audit-only sink mode (recommended on cpex with the audit seam, PR #166):** omit
`hooks:` entirely. The plugin then auto-attaches as a **decision-audit sink**
(`Plugin::as_audit_handler`) and fires at every pipeline verdict — **denials
included** — with the executor's `DecisionLog`: verdict → `action_id`/`disposition`
(Denied/Blocked with the violation at `status_code`/`status_detail`, Modified,
Allowed), and the ordered per-plugin steps (incl. `deny_ignored` / `aborted`;
on PPE a denying step also carries its violation as `detail` — AID-EMIT-1 §9.2),
span, entry taint, content hashes and the `(epoch, stream_id, stream_seq,
emission_seq)` stream stamps under `unmapped.cpex.*`, inside the hashed bytes.

```yaml
plugin_settings:
  # Optional (cpex feat/audit-seam >= bd39d2c): name the host, and the
  # executor stamps its streams as gw-1:decision / gw-1:effect instead of
  # the bare labels — one host identity, two independently gap-free
  # counters. The epoch is deliberately NOT a YAML value (a static file
  # epoch cannot stay monotonic across boots); a host that supplies one
  # sets `plugin_settings.audit_epoch` in code before `load_config`.
  audit_stream_namespace: gw-1
plugins:
  - name: ocsf-audit
    kind: audit/ocsf
    # no `hooks:` -> decision-audit sink mode (sees denials)
    capabilities:
      - read_agent
      - read_delegation
      - read_labels
    config:
      destination: stderr
      chain: true
```

**Declare the capabilities.** A sink is filtered on the same terms as any other
plugin: the engine hands it a view built from its own `plugins:` entry, not the
executor's working copy. Of the typed fields this plugin maps, `request`, `mcp`
and `completion` are ungated, but `agent`, `delegation` and security labels each
sit behind a read capability. Omit them and the records still emit, still chain
and still verify -- carrying no `ai_agent` block, no `delegation` block and no
labels. That is a silent evidence loss rather than a load error: a verifier
cannot tell "no delegation occurred" from "the sink was not permitted to see
it". Declare all three unless a deployment deliberately withholds one.

`examples/panic_drive.rs` is the runnable form of this wiring — a `PluginManager`
loading exactly this shape through `load_config`, with a plugin that panics, so the
record it emits is a real fail-closed deny on the host-named stream.

> `engine_settings:`, and it must declare `dispatch: hooks` — PPE defaults to

**Post-hook observer mode (legacy; pre-seam cpex):** list the CMF POST hooks to
observe. This path sees allowed traffic only — it structurally cannot record a
denial — and a hook-listed instance deliberately does **not** also attach as a
sink, so one invocation never emits twice.

```yaml
routes:
  - tool: get_compensation
    policy:
      - "require(role.hr)"
      - "delegate(workday-oauth, target: workday-api, permissions: [read_compensation])"
      - "run(audit-log)"        # existing enforcement steps unchanged

## Status

Built **green** against `contextforge-org/cpex@feat/hil_apl` commit `ad666ba` — Teryl's
review baseline (`cargo build` clean, 2026-07-20). Every CMF accessor path and
`ContentPart` variant shape was confirmed against that commit. Re-verified against the
**public `dev` branch** at `baa9e17` (2026-07-27): build, tests, and the `emit_sample`
example pass unchanged — no API drift between the two. The 2026-07-31 revision (DSSE
signer wired, `authority_uid`; **21 tests**, all green, sample output byte-identical
across runs) was verified against the local checkout on `feat/ocsf-audit-plugin`
@ `9fe56e5`.

**Revision 0.0.2 (2026-07-20) — P0 + review §4-B**, per the production-readiness plan
(2026-07-17) and the decisions closed on the 2026-07-18 thread:

- **Host class applied: API Activity (6003)** — the `6010` placeholder and bespoke
  activity enum are gone. Activity ids follow API Activity's real enum with conformant
  OCSF captions: resources/prompts and `readOnlyHint: true` tools → `2 (Read)`;
  other tool invocations → `99 (Other)` + `activity_name: "Invoke Tool"`; completions →
  `99` + `"Completion"`. `destructiveHint` stays security context, never a Delete claim.
- **Profiles declared:** `metadata.profiles = ["ai_operation", "security_control"]`
  (+ `"record_integrity"` when chaining is on). The passive post-hook stream carries
  `action_id: 3 (Observed)` / `disposition_id: 17 (Logged)`; deny/modify mappings
  (`action_id` 2/4) wait on the cpex-core decision event (WS-A / P1).
- **Predecessor binding fixed (review §4-B):** the fingerprint is SHA-256 over the JCS
  canonical bytes of the event *including* its own `chain_uid` and `prev_event` — the
  predecessor and chain id are part of the hashed input, so chain order is
  cryptographically bound and records can't be spliced across chains. The signer consumes
  the same bytes, committing the DSSE signature to the record's chain position.

**Merged #1661 shape, applied 2026-07-31.** PR #1661 merged upstream 2026-07-17
(`2a244bc9`), so the emitted carrier is now `attestation_list[]` with `fingerprint` /
`prev_event` / `signatures` objects, replacing the draft `attestation` member with string
`entry_hash` / `prev_entry_hash` / singular `signature`. Two consequences worth naming:
the fingerprint is computed per the merged semantics (whole event, minus only
`fingerprint`/`signatures`), so **a verifier following the schema can reproduce it without
knowing this crate's conventions** — the previous construction hashed a private wrapper
object. And `metadata.uid` is now emitted, because `prev_event.uid` has to point at
something. Separately, `correlation_uid` moved to `metadata`, which is where OCSF defines
it; it had been emitted at the event root, where no OCSF consumer would look.

**Review corrections applied 2026-07-06** (from Teryl Taylor's review of the mapping):

- **C6 — prompt hooks now actually fire.** Earlier revisions registered on
  `cmf.prompt_post_fetch`, which the Rust CMF/APL runtime never dispatches — prompt events
  were silently dropped. Registration moved to `cmf.prompt_pre/post_invoke` (see the
  hook-name note above).
- **C1 — `correlation_uid` now correlates.** It mirrors the run id
  (`AgentExtension.conversation_id`), the same value on every event of a run; the per-call
  `tool_call_id` moved to `api.request.uid`.
- **C2 caveat — canonicalization implemented.** Events are JCS-style canonically serialized
  (sorted keys; set-derived arrays sorted at build time), so an independent verifier can
  recompute the fingerprint chain from the emitted JSON. See below.

Honest inventory of what's solid vs. open:

- **Solid + tested:** plugin/factory/hook structure (modeled on `audit-logger`), the OCSF
  event builder, the hash-chain logic, the gap-field mapping (`stop_reason`, `mcp`,
  `framework`, monotonic labels, workload identity), and the mapped objects (`ai_agent`,
  `delegation`, `message_context`). See the test module in `src/emitter.rs` and the runnable
  `examples/emit_sample.rs` / `SAMPLE-OUTPUT.md`.
- **Content provenance vector (2026-10-01):** `examples/provenance_demo.rs` /
  `SAMPLE-OUTPUT-PROVENANCE.md` pin the `unmapped."cpex.content"` digest form of
  AID-EMIT-1 section 9.2: unchanged content, a redaction, a rotated key, and the
  explicit unkeyed form. On PPE the digests come from the engine's own `ContentKey`
  under keys resolved through its secret store; the keys and the canonical audit
  bytes are printed so every digest recomputes offline. On cpex, which has no
  provenance key, records 1 to 3 carry the unkeyed form instead.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-20 (was: needs a standards call):** `ai_operation` is an OCSF
  **profile**, not a class — the host class is now **API Activity (6003)**, agreed on the
  2026-07-18 thread (matching AOS's host-class choice and AI Identity's production
  gateway). Remaining conformance caveat: the `emits_required_ocsf_base_fields` test
  checks structural conformance only, **not** full schema validation — validating against
  the published OCSF schema in CI is the open WS-E item.
- **Signing (wired 2026-07-31):** `sign::DsseSigner` produces ECDSA-P256-SHA256 over the
  DSSE PAE of the same canonical bytes the fingerprint covers, deterministic per RFC 6979.
  Enum ids verified against ocsf-schema main: `digital_signature.algorithm_id` 3 = ECDSA,
  `serialization_id` 5 = DSSE (a different enum than `fingerprint.algorithm_id`, where
  3 = SHA-256). The key is operator-provided PKCS#8 PEM (`signing_key_pem` /
  `signing_key_pem_path`) — a key handle, not a key service: custody (HSM/KMS residency,
  rotation epochs, JWKS publication and never unpublishing old versions) belongs to the
  authority named by `attestation.authority_uid`, which sits inside the hashed bytes so
  the claimed authority cannot be swapped post-hoc. Verifier rule as running code:
  `sign::signing_input` reconstructs the covered bytes from an emitted event (strip
  `fingerprint`/`signatures` + the post-hash `unmapped.signature_b64`/`signature_key_id`
  extras, which await a schema home via
  [ocsf-schema#1709](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1709)); then the
  fingerprint recomputes and the signature verifies over `sign::dsse_pae` of those bytes —
  exercised end-to-end by the `signed_event_verifies_offline` test and printed as the
  `// verify` lines of `cargo run --example emit_sample`. This closes the *identity* half
  of the "verifies offline" claim; both halves are now delivered.
- **Canonicalization (review C2 caveat — FIXED 2026-07-06):** the fingerprint and the signer
  now consume `sign::canonical_bytes`, an explicit JCS-style serializer (sorted keys,
  compact output, independent of serde_json feature flags). Set-derived arrays —
  `cmf.security.labels`, `actor.roles`, `actor.user.groups`, previously randomized
  `HashSet`/`MonotonicSet` iteration order — are sorted at build time in `ocsf.rs`, so the
  same logical event always canonicalizes to the same bytes and an independent verifier
  recomputing the fingerprint gets our value. Covered by the `canonical_form_is_sorted_and_compact`
  and `set_derived_arrays_are_sorted_for_canonical_hashing` tests.

## Building

The crate builds against one of two host engines, chosen by a Cargo feature.
Both carry the same audit seam and produce byte-identical records
(`PRAXIS-PORT-RESULTS.md`).

```bash
# cpex (default): a local checkout next to the AI-Identity repo, at the
# rev .github/workflows/rust.yml pins.
#   git clone https://github.com/contextforge-org/cpex ../../../cpex
#   git -C ../../../cpex checkout 64c8eba85fac28fa7e73b6c83d32aca7356ca23d
cargo build
cargo test

# ppe: praxis-proxy/policy PR #84 (Teryl's port of the seam into the Praxis
# Policy Engine), a git dependency pinned by rev in Cargo.toml — no sibling
# checkout needed. Exactly one host feature per build.
cargo test --no-default-features --features ppe
```

Every engine type the source names goes through `crate::host::…` (`src/lib.rs`),
which is `cpex_core` or `praxis_policy_core` depending on the feature. The one
shape difference between the two seams — PPE binds the violation to a
`Denied` / `DenyIgnored` step, cpex leaves it on the verdict — is absorbed by
three helpers in that module and nowhere else.
